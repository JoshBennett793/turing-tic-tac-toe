## 📚 Learning Goals
- Solidify and demonstrate my understanding of:
    - DRY JavaScript
    - event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Iterate through/filter DOM elements using only for loops
- Use a problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
